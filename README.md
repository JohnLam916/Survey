# survey
Challenge: Create a Survey

For this challenge, I will take user input at the command line of a list of at least ten (10) questions that I made up. 

My code will print out different messages to the user depending on how they answer each question.

The survey will feature multiple datatypes.

I will also use logical operators (and, or, & not)
